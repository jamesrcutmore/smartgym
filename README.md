 ## Deployment & Local Development

 ## **Deployment**

### **Heroku Deployment**

I deployed this project to heroku using the following steps:

#### **Create Flask Application**

- Log into Heruko
- Under dashboard, Select "Create New App"
- Choose an app name (it shows in red if the name is already taken)
- select a region base on your location
- click "Create app"

### Deploying to Github Pages

* Choose the repository you want to deploy from the main overview.
* Go to settings by clicking on the icon on the menu.
* In the left navigation, select the "Pages" option.
* Under "Source", choose "Master" branch and click "Save".
* After it's done, you will see a message saying "Your site is ready to be published at (insert url here)".

### Local Development
#### How To Fork

Forking a repository is the process of creating a copy of the original repository. This enables you to make changes without affecting the main repository. 

To do so:-
* go to the GitHub repository you want to copy.
* select the 'Fork' button located in the top right corner, under your profile icon. 
* Once complete, you will now have your own version of the repository to make changes to.

#### How To Clone

To copy a GitHub repository:-
* first navigate to the repository you wish to copy. 
* click on the 'Code' button (which has a download icon) and copy the link provided.
* in the Gitpod Terminal, navigate to the directory where you wish to place the clone. Then, type 'git clone' and paste the link you copied earlier and press enter. This process can also be completed using VSCode.
